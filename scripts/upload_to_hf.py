This dataset contains pre-trained BEATs (Bidirectional Encoder representation from Audio Transformers) model checkpoints.

## Files

{chr(10).join(f"- **{f.name}**: BEATs checkpoint ({f.stat().st_size / 1024 / 1024:.1f} MB)" for f in checkpoint_files)}

## Usage

These checkpoints are automatically downloaded by the `beats-trainer` Python package:

```python
from beats_trainer import BEATsFeatureExtractor

# Automatically downloads and uses checkpoints
extractor = BEATsFeatureExtractor()
```

## Source

These checkpoints are distributed as part of the [beats-trainer](https://github.com/ninanor/beats-trainer) project.

## License

These model weights are provided by Microsoft Research under their respective license terms.
